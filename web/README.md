This folder contains the web server portion of the final product.

The web-server requires Tornado to run - It is found at http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/
It can be downloaded via Python pip (pip install tornado)

Running web_main.py (with ./web_main.py) will start the server on port 8080 by default

It also requires a mysql database with name of 3YP. This can be customised in web_main.
